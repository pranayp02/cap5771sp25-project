Project Title: BOOK RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING CONTENT-BASED AND COLLABORATIVE FILTERING TECHINQUES 

The objective of the project is to develop a recommendation system that suggests books to the 
users based on the reading preferences and historical ratings. The goal of the project is to 
implement content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized 
book recommendations. The project aims to analyze the user behavior and books metadata to 
improve the recommendation system’s accuracy. 
This project will be implemented as a web application developed using Streamlit. This enables 
users to input their preferences, ratings, and then the system will generate recommendations based 
on user’s profile of historical ratings and book preferences. 

Milestone 1: Data Collection, Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis
Datasets are taken from the Kaggle.(Books.csv, Ratings.csv, Users.csv)
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data distribution.
Performed data preprocessing to clean and merge datasets.
Analyzed user behavior and book metadata for better recommendations.
